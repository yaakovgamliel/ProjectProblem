// Hi There :)
// This is a test project written purrly.
// it supposed to let you browse in directory and show files.
// it works, but YOU can make it better.
// make it better code and design, but leave the same functionality (you can also fix bugs if you encounter them)
//
// NO NEED TO CHANGE THE UI AND ADD CONTROLLERS
